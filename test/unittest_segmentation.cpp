// A sample program demonstrating using Google C++ testing framework.

// This sample shows how to write a simple unit test for a function,
// using Google C++ testing framework.
//
// Writing a unit test using Google C++ testing framework is easy as 1-2-3:


// Step 1. Include necessary header files such that the stuff your
// test logic needs is declared.
//
// Don't forget gtest.h, which declares the testing framework.
#include <gtest/gtest.h>
#include "../source/segmentation/include/segmentation.hpp"

// Step 2. Use the TEST macro to define your tests.
//
// TEST has two parameters: the test case name and the test name.
// After using the macro, you should define your test logic between a
// pair of braces.  You can use a bunch of macros to indicate the
// success or failure of a test.  EXPECT_TRUE and EXPECT_EQ are
// examples of such macros.  For a complete list, see gtest.h.
//
// <TechnicalDetails>
//
// In Google Test, tests are grouped into test cases.  This is how we
// keep test code organized.  You should put logically related tests
// into the same test case.
//
// The test case name and the test name should both be valid C++
// identifiers.  And you should not use underscore (_) in the names.
//
// Google Test guarantees that each test you define is run exactly
// once, but it makes no guarantee on the order the tests are
// executed.  Therefore, you should write your tests in such a way
// that their results don't depend on their order.
//
// </TechnicalDetails>

class PlanarAndEuclideanTest : public ::testing::Test {
 protected:
  virtual void SetUp() {
  }

  virtual void TearDown() {
    // Code here will be called immediately after each test
    // (right before the destructor).
  }
};

// Tests PlanarAndEuclidean()
/*
*/
TEST(PlanarAndEuclideanTest, Size)
{
  srand (time (NULL));

  pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ>::Ptr cloud (new pcl::PointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ>);
  // Generate pointcloud data
  cloud->width = 1000;
  cloud->height = 1;
  cloud->points.resize (cloud->width * cloud->height);

  for (size_t i = 0; i < cloud->points.size (); ++i)
  {
    cloud->points[i].x = 1024.0f * rand () / (RAND_MAX + 1.0f);
    cloud->points[i].y = 1024.0f * rand () / (RAND_MAX + 1.0f);
    cloud->points[i].z = 1024.0f * rand () / (RAND_MAX + 1.0f);
  }
  PlanarAndEuclidean<pcl::PointXYZ> pl_ec;
  pl_ec.setNube(*cloud);
  int orig_cloud_size = 0;
  orig_cloud_size = cloud->points.size();
  EXPECT_EQ(orig_cloud_size, pl_ec.getSizeNube());
}

// Step 3. Call RUN_ALL_TESTS() in main().
//
// We do this by linking in src/gtest_main.cc file, which consists of
// a main() function which calls RUN_ALL_TESTS() for us.
//
// This runs all the tests you've defined, prints the result, and
// returns 0 if successful, or 1 otherwise.
//
// Did you notice that we didn't register the tests?  The
// RUN_ALL_TESTS() macro magically knows about all the tests we
// defined.  Isn't this convenient?
